     I attempted to create a standalone EXE file using the PyInstaller module.
Although the standalone EXE file functions perfectly, But Microsoft Defender
antivirus identifies it as a false positive. Consequently, I am unable to 
distribute it in its current form. Instead, I will provide instructions on
how users can download the data using the source code.

To run the Python script "Getbhavcopy-Eq-Ind.py," please follow these steps:
   1)  Install Python: If you haven't already installed Python on your computer,     
            please download the latest version from the official Python website 
            (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions.

   2)  Download the Zip file from the following URL:<br>
            https://github.com/pparesh25/Getbhavcopy-alternative/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
            Extract the contents of the Zip file and copy the file "Final_Bhavcopy_index_2024.py" to your desktop.

   3)  Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select the option "Open in Terminal"
            (or "Open PowerShell window here" depending on your operating system).

   4)  In the opened terminal or PowerShell window,
       install the required modules by typing the following command and pressing Enter
          -->> pip install requests pandas <<-- 
        installation of modules is one time process after that you just need to follow step 5), 6) and 7)

   5)  After the installation is complete, download the end-of-day (EOD) data by typing the 
            following command in the terminal and pressing Enter-->> python Final_Bhavcopy_index_2024.py <<-- 
            or type -->> py <<-- and drag and drop -->> Final_Bhavcopy_index_2024.py <<-- file to terminal and hit enter

   6) First time the script will prompt you to enter a start date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" 
            Please enter the desired start date, e.g., 2023-05-01, and press Enter.

   7)  Similarly, the script will prompt you to enter an end date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" 
            Please enter the desired end date, e.g., 2023-05-25, and press Enter.

     
       If your Python installation and required modules are correct, the script will proceed to download
the data and save it in the directory "C:/Getbhavcopy_NSE"

       Please follow these steps carefully, and let me know if you encounter any issues.
